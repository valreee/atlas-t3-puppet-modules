	at3	- Atlas Tier 3 node configurations base on the modules in this project

                  does not accept queue submission

	nfs     - Class for creating and nfs client and server. [TESTED]
	panda   - Panda set up.  The puppet configuration has been tested but it has not been used

+ classes are prefixed with cls_
+ definitions have no prefixes
